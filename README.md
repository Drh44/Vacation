# Vacation
Program that takes information for different vacations and decides if the user can afford them or not while detailing the cost of everything. 

The program uses a abstract class called vacation that the two types of vacation pulls information from. 
The two types of vacations are an all inclusive one and one where each item has to be paid for separately.
Program is hard coded with different types of vacations but could easily be made to take user input.
